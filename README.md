# UFOs

##Purpose##
  The purpose of this analysis is to show what java scripts can do, meaning that they can store, filter and display. With Java Script we can sort data that was collected and display it where we can filter and look around where we want to.
  
 ##Overview##
  Organizing UFO data in a JavaScript array where the user can sort through. The user can filter through all the UFO data, by date, city, state, country, and shape.

##Summary##

Drawbacks:

The drawbacks are the user error meaning that the user can missspell something can the interface won't forgive them for it, misspell of the city or country.
Also the missing other filters. Some filter can be exclusive for UFOs because there are different looks of the UFO, lights, size and color.

What can be improved is more filters, meaning more choices for the user. Another recommandation is adding a submission page meaning that if there are new sitings the user can also help with more data.
